Penzil is a web application for sketching in 3d, powered by three.js and Vue. It is intended to be a light version of Blender's Grease pencil for the web. Penzil is designed for tablet with a pen, but it should work on desktop as well.

See the [Roadmap](https://github.com/jacopocolo/Penzil/projects/1) for upcoming features.
